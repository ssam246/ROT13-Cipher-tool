## **How to Use**

1. **Launch the Application**:
   - Upon running, the application window will open with input/output fields and controls.

2. **Enter Text**:
   - Type your text into the **Input** field. The processed output will appear in the **Output** field in real time.

3. **Adjust the Offset**:
   - Use the **Cipher Offset** spinner to change the ROT cipher offset (default is 13).

4. **Copy Output**:
   - Click the **Copy Output** button to copy the encrypted/decrypted text to your clipboard.

5. **Clear Fields**:
   - Use the **Clear** button to reset both input and output fields.

---

## **Example Workflow**

1. **Input Text**:
   Enter the following text in the input field:
   ```
   HelloWorld
   ```

2. **Adjust Offset**:
   Set the cipher offset to `13`.

3. **Output**:
   The output field will display:
   ```
   UryybJbeyq
   ```

4. **Copy to Clipboard**:
   Click **Copy Output** to copy `UryybJbeyq` to your clipboard.

## **Error Handling**

- **Empty Output**:
  - If you attempt to copy without any text in the output field, the application displays a warning message:  
    *"Output is empty!"*

- **Invalid Offset**:
  - The spinner only allows offsets between 1 and 25 to ensure valid ROT cipher operations.
